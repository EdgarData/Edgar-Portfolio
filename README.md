Data and ML notebooks

Analysis of an existing fin-tech specialized in financial products. There are 3 different datasets. Our main purpose is to:

- Understand how information is registered.
- Know exactly which type of customers are actually buying our products. (new customers existing ones)
- How many new activation we have per period, as well as churn and cancellations.
- Since is a binary dataset (speaking about products), we need to know total number of products bought by customer.
- How much profit are we getting from each type of product (which is the winner).
- NAÂ´s and outliers inside the data (what to do with them ones understanding the data).
